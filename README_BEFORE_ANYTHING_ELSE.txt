Hello,

I have partially completed the assigment, in my opinion, given from you as you will see in the UnityLog.xml the results are not the one the Unity's testRunner returns.

This is due to the issue with the Package com.unity.xr.management@4.0.1 has invalid dependencies.

I have done a fair bit of research of why this is happening and tried to reimport the XR package which in turn has returned even more Packages not being found.

During my research on the matter I seen that this is a known issue for Unity from 2018 and people are still experiencing it even now, I've seen posts from 10-10-2023 finding different
way to solve the issue which I tried and have resulted in me reverting them back as they cause more issues then when I started with.

Instead of the command line script I would have prefered to create a script similar to the one in the link: https://forum.unity.com/threads/unit-test-export-xml-from-script.1104091/

But seeing as the assigment was to create a script to run the TestRunner script from a command line this is my submission, for which I'm not happy at all by the way but I tried
to keep in the assigment lines.

Regarding the tests from the NewTestScript.cs I have done some very simple EditMode tests which involved Debug.Log for the game being on, camera and controller positions 
and a turn off the light check. I did this simple tests as one might one to see if the game is running before anything else and that the positions of the main assets are ok.
The turning off of the light "test" was something I wanted to try to see if I remember how to call components.

That's it, thank you very much and wish you the best.
